# Jetton honeypot detection mode

[Checking mode](checking-mode) is a more flexible mode of `TSA` operation that allows to implement different checkers to validate specific contract specifications.
One of the possible use cases is detecting jetton honeypots – tokens that are designed to scam users by preventing them from reselling tokens after purchase.

This mode is represented as a separate module – take a look at its [README.md](https://github.com/espritoxyz/tsa/blob/bd366b298503cbf0b9c4f5551c4ac95a8166add7/tsa-jettons/README.md) for more details.
