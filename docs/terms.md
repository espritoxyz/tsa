The source code of TSA is released under the MIT License, which governs your rights to use, modify, and distribute the code itself. These Terms do not modify or override the MIT License, and apply primarily to our hosted website, published binaries, logos, and any interaction with Espirito Tech QFZ LLC outside the open-source repository.

By accessing or using the Site or TSA distributions, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

## 4. Privacy and Data Collection

TSA is designed as a **local-only**, **offline-first** tool. It does **not** collect, transmit, or process any user data or metadata. No personal information is ever sent to our servers (because we have none integrated).
Our website https://tonan.tech is equally private. We do **not** use cookies, trackers, analytics tools, or session IDs.
For full details, please review our [Privacy Policy](privacy_policy.md), which is incorporated into these Terms by reference.

## 5. No Warranty

As defined by the MIT License, TSA is provided **"as is"**, without warranty of any kind. Espirito Tech QFZ LLC disclaims all express or implied warranties, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

We do not guarantee that:
- TSA or our Site will be error-free or uninterrupted;
- any known or unknown bugs will be fixed;
- any results obtained from the use of TSA will be accurate, complete, or reliable.

## 6. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages resulting from your use of TSA or our Site, even if we were advised of the possibility of such damages.

This includes, but is not limited to, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or business opportunities.

## 7. Trademarks and Attribution

“TSA,” “TON Symbolic Analyzer,” and the Espirito Tech logo are trademarks of **Espirito Tech QFZ LLC**. You may refer to TSA nominally (e.g., “built on TSA”), but **you may not use our marks or branding in a misleading or promotional way** without explicit written permission.

When distributing or modifying TSA, you must retain the original copyright notice and license file, per the MIT License.

## 8. External Dependencies and Notices

Binary distributions of TSA may contain third-party libraries, each of which is governed by its own license. We include all such notices and license files in our distributions. You are responsible for reviewing and complying with those terms when using binary builds.

## 9. Export Control and Sanctions

You agree to comply with all applicable export control laws and regulations, including those of the United States, European Union, Qatar, or other relevant jurisdictions. You must not use or distribute TSA in violation of any embargo or sanction.

## 10. Contributions and Feedback

If you submit code, feedback, or other content to the TSA project or to Espirito Tech, you:
- Grant us the right to use, modify, and incorporate your contributions into the TSA project under the MIT License;
- Confirm that your contributions are your own original work or otherwise legally provided;
- Agree not to submit material that infringes on third-party rights.

## 11. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. The current version is always available at https://tonan.tech/terms, with the date of last update indicated at the bottom.

If you continue using TSA or our Site after changes are posted, you accept those changes.

## 12. Termination

We reserve the right to restrict or terminate your access to the Site or our binary distributions at any time, without notice, for conduct that we reasonably believe violates these Terms. This does not limit your rights to continue using the open-source code under the MIT License.
