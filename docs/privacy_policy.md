# Privacy Policy

**TON Symbolic Analyzer (TSA)**

## 1. General Information

Welcome to **TON Symbolic Analyzer** ("TSA" or "Software"), developed and distributed by **Espirito Tech QFZ LLC** ("we", "us", or "our").

This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you — the user of TSA or our site (https://tonan.tech/,"Site") — about our data practices. Specifically, we want to emphasize that **TSA is designed to function entirely within your own computing environment**. It does not transmit any data to us or any third party, and we do not collect, track, store, analyze, or share any personal data or metadata. And we don’t collect any data or metadata and we also don’t use cookies technology there on our Site.

You can use TSA with confidence, knowing that **no information leaves your device**.

You can use our Site with confidence, knowing that **no information leaves your device**.

This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Use available at https://tonan.tech/terms/, and should be read in conjunction with them.

## 2. Who We Are

**Espirito Tech QFZ LLC** is the developer and copyright holder of TSA.

Our registered office is located at:

**Office 62, Ras Bufontas Admin Building**

**Building 43, Street 517, Zone 49**

**Ras Bufontas Free Zone, Doha, The State of Qatar**

**License No. FZA 578**

You can reach us at: sales@tonan.tech

## 3. No Personal Data Collection

TSA is a **fully self-contained desktop tool** that can be used as:

- A standalone CLI utility (including via Docker containers)
- A Java-based library embedded in user environments

At no point does TSA connect to our servers or to any third party service, nor does it send, receive, or synchronize data over the internet.

**We do not collect:**
- Personal information (such as names, email addresses, or user IDs)
- Technical device data (such as IP addresses, OS type, browser version)
- Usage metrics or telemetry of any kind
- Cookies, tracking scripts, or session identifiers

## 4. Offline-First and Privacy-First Design

TSA is built on the principles of **data minimization and user autonomy**. This means:
- All analysis and processing occurs **locally**, on the user’s machine.
- No logs or diagnostic data are transmitted back to us.
- There are no embedded third-party SDKs or trackers.

You can inspect the tool, run it in isolated environments, or audit its behavior using local system monitoring tools — everything it does is visible and under your control.

## 5. Legal Ground and Consent

Because TSA does not collect or process any personal data, **no legal basis for data processing under GDPR, CCPA, or other privacy frameworks is required**.

Accordingly, there is no need for you to provide consent, and we do not process or retain any information that could trigger the obligations of such regulations.

## 6. Data Storage and Security
Since we do not collect or receive any data, **we do not store any of your data**, either temporarily or permanently.

All information processed by TSA remains within your local infrastructure, whether it’s on your laptop, in a Docker container, or within your server architecture.

We encourage users to take appropriate security precautions when using the Tool in sensitive environments, as with any local software.

## 7. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not share, sell, transfer, or disclose your data — **because we never have access to it in the first place**.

There are no service providers, sub-processors, or third-party integrations involved in the operation of TSA.

## 8. International Transfers

As no data is collected, processed, or transmitted — **no international data transfers occur**. Your data never leaves your own systems.

## 9. Your Rights

As TSA does not process personal data, **there is no stored information that we can provide, modify, delete, or transfer** on your behalf.

If you have questions about data protection or privacy compliance in relation to TSA, feel free to contact us — but rest assured, the Tool is intentionally built not to hold or process any user data.

## 10. Children’s Privacy

TSA is a professional-grade utility designed for software developers, security engineers, and enterprise users. **It is not intended for use by children**, and we do not knowingly collect any data from minors.

## 11. Automated Decisions and Profiling

TSA contains **no automated decision-making or profiling mechanisms**. It performs static or dynamic analysis depending on the configuration — **all locally** and without impact on user identity, profile, or behavior.

## 12. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may revise this Privacy Policy in the future if there are changes to TSA’s architecture, licensing model, or distribution practices.

If changes are made, we will update the version posted at https://tonan.tech/privacy and indicate the date of the last update.

However, **as long as TSA remains a local-only tool, no data collection will ever occur**.
