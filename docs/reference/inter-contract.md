# Inter-contract Analysis

TSA allows to analyze intaraction of several contracts. This can be done in `custom-checker` or `inter-contract` modes.

If you want to use a message which was generated in some contract as an input of some other contract, you need to set **communication scheme**.
It is a JSON file that is passed with `--scheme` CLI option.

## Communication Scheme Format

The expected JSON is an array of contract handlers (one handler for each contract).

```
Contract handler:
  - id: Int
  - inOpcodeToDestination: Map<String, DestinationDescription>
  - [optional] other: DestinationDescription
```

The keys in `inOpcodeToDestination` are hex strings of length 8 that represent opcodes (the first 32 bits of message body).

Field `other` specifies destinations of messages 
that were generated by contract `id` when its input message body 
either had length less then 32 bits or started with opcode that wasn't specified in `inOpcodeToDestination` field.

Message destinations can be described in two formats: `linear` and `out_opcodes`. The chosen format is specified with `type` field.

```
Linear destination description:
  - type: String = "linear"
  - destinations: Array<Int>
```

`destinations` must be an array that has the same size as the expected number of sent messages. The contents of the array are id's of destinations contracts.

```
Destination description based on out opcodes:
  - type: String = "out_opcodes"
  - outOpcodeToDestination: Map<String, Array<Int>>
  - [optional] other: Array<Int>
```

`outOpcodeToDestination` is a map where keys are hex strings of length 8 that represent opcodes of the outgoing messages.
If an outgoing message has length less than 32 bits or its opcode isn't specified in `outOpcodeToDestination`, then its destination is described with `other` field.

### Example: scheme for jetton-wallet

Contract 1: jetton-wallet 1 owner.

Contract 2: jetton-wallet 1.

Contract 3: jetton-wallet 2.

Contract 4: jetton-wallet 2 owner.

```
[
  // Contract 1 sends all messages to contract 2
  {
    "id": 1,
    "inOpcodeToDestination": {},
    "other": {
      "type": "out_opcodes",
      "outOpcodeToDestination": {},
      "other": [2]
    }
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "inOpcodeToDestination": {
      "0f8a7ea5": {  // op::transfer
        "type": "out_opcodes",
        "outOpcodeToDestination": {
          "178d4519": [3]  // op::internal_transfer
        }
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "inOpcodeToDestination": {
      "178d4519": {  // op::internal_transfer
        "type": "out_opcodes",
        "outOpcodeToDestination": {
          "d53276db": [1],  // op::excesses
          "7362d09c": [4]  // op::transfer_notification
        }
      }
    }
  },
  // Contract 4 doesn't send any messages
  {
    "id": 4,
    "inOpcodeToDestination": {}
  }
]
```
